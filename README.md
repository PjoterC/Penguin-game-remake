# Penguin-game-remake
My own take on the original penguin game group project

This is an improved version of the penguin game made in a group for university credit (Penguin-game repository).
It is meant to show my improvement in C programming and writing logic in code.


  The objective is to move the pawns (Penguins) on the rectangular board of ice floes, in order to collect points (fish).
  The fish floes are displayed on the board as numbers 1, 2, 3 (indicating the amount of fish on the ice floe).
  The penguins are displayed as coloured numbers, each player has a different colour.
  When penguin leaves the ice floe, it will sink, leaving behind a water tile (0).
  Players can move 1 tile in 4 directions.
  Movement that ends on a water tile, other penguin or outside of the board is prohibited.
  Players can play against simple AI - player settings are set at the beginning with the user input.
  The game ends when no player can make a move.
